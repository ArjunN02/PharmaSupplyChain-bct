# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Tracking System

## Description

This project introduces a medication supply chain tracking system utilizing blockchain technology. The implementation enhances transparency and traceability in the pharmaceutical industry by leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain. Through this system, stakeholders in the supply chain, including manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, can securely record and verify the journey of medications from production to distribution.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before running the project:

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Hardhat:** Install Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum. You can install it globally using:

  ```bash
  npm install -g hardhat
